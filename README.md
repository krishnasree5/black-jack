blackjack rules
at the beginning the player and dealer(computer) are  given two cards
only one card of the dealer is shown.All the cards the player got are shown
the player can hit or stand till the value of their cards is close to 21
king,queen,jack have a value of 10, ace can have 1 or 11 (the player can adjust it) and the remaining cards have the same value
hit means he gets a card from the deck and stand means he can stop drawing cards and it's the computer's turn
while the player is hitting if the value is >21 he is busted(loses) and the dealer/computer wins
if the player choses to stand, the dealer keeps on hitting cards till his value is close to 21.
if his value is > player's value and closer to 21 he wins
if his value is >21 he is busted and the player wins
