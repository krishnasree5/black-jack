blackjack rules

at the beginning the player and dealer(computer) are  given two cards

only one card of the dealer is shown.All the cards the player got are shown

the player can hit or stand till the value of their cards is close to 21

king,queen,jack have a value of 10, ace can have 1 or 11 (the player can adjust it) and the remaining cards have the same value

hit means he gets a card from the deck and stand means he can stop drawing cards and it's the computer's turn

while the player is hitting if the value is >21 he is busted(loses) and the dealer/computer wins

if the player choses to stand, the dealer keeps on hitting cards till his value is close to 21.

if his value is > player's value and closer to 21 he wins

if his value is >21 he is busted and the player wins
